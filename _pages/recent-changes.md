This website contains recent policy changes reported in the global
[Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker
(OxCGRT)](www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/covidtracker) database. It includes policies
which have come into force within the last two weeks. It is arranged by
country and then by indicator. For more details on the coding policy
please see our
[Codebook](https://github.com/OxCGRT/covid-policy-tracker/blob/master/documentation/codebook.md)
and [Interpretation
Guide](https://github.com/OxCGRT/covid-policy-tracker/blob/master/documentation/interpretation_guide.md).

Data in the OxCGRT database is recorded by volunteers from all over the
world on a weekly schedule. Our coverage may not yet be completely
up-to-date until the present day with recent policy changes. This site
is updated daily, so check back for the latest information.

## Global Changes in Government Response Index

The Government Response Index is an aggregate summary of all 20 of our
policy indicators. The index goes from 0 to 100, and a higher number
generally means a more active policy (eg. more stringent restrictions,
more generous economic support, or more pro-active public health
measures).
<!-- The following map shows countries that have changed their response at some point during the last two weeks, resulting in an increase or decrease in the overall Government Response Index. -->
The headings for each country report how the index has changed from two
weeks ago. For more detail on the Government Response Index please see
our most recent [working
paper](https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/publications/variation-government-responses-covid-19)
or explore our [dataset
publication](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41562-021-01079-8).

On 16 july 2021, Ontario became the last province to allow indoor
shopping malls, fitness studios and indoor dining to open with public
health guidelines in force. The three westernmost provinces have removed
many covid-related public health guidelines for business operations. No
jurisdiction is setting rules differentiating between business owners,
employees or customers based on vaccination status. See See Province of
Ontario and Retail Council of Canada websites, archived:

On 16 July 2021, the rules set by each province and territory vary.
Ontario became the last province to allow indoor public events: “Indoor
meeting and event spaces permitted to operate with physical distancing
and other restrictions still in effect and capacity limited to not
exceed 50 per cent capacity or 1,000 people, (whichever is less)”.
Effective 1 July, the province of Alberta removed capacity and other
limits on all public events in favour of optional guidelines for
distancing and record-keeping. Effective 11 July, Saskatchewan
implemented “the removal of limits on events”. In other provinces and
territories, public events are permitted with capacity limits, mask
requirements and other guidelines. No jurisdiction is setting rules
differentiating between event participants based on vaccination status.

Effective 18 july 2021, the government of Canada continues to pay the
Canada Recovery Benefit (CRB) to self-employed Canadians who have lost
income, but the benefit for new claimants is now C$300/week. The
original C$500/week benefit level was about 50% of pre-crisis average
weekly earnings (excluding overtime) of just over C$1,000/week. The new
benefit level is just below 30% of pre-crisis average earnings. (Average
weekly earnings of employed Canadians have increased significantly in
part thanks to the reduction in employment in low-wage sectors such as
hospitality that have been hit harder by the covid crisis.) Employment
Insurance benefits and eligibility rules for formerly employed Canadians
continue to be enhanced relative to pre-covid rules. See Government of
Canada website, archived:

On 16 july 2021, the provincial and territorial governments continue to
be responsible for regulating long-term care (LTC) homes with the
government of Canada providing guidance to protect residents and staff
from covid-19. Effective 16 July, Ontario, Canada’s most populous
province, “is lifting mandatory COVID-19 testing for fully vaccinated
visitors, caregivers and staff at long-term care homes … \[and\] limits
on visitors, …buffet dining, resident absences, off-site excursions and
activities such as singing and dancing…Partly vaccinated or unvaccinated
people will still need to be tested … The province has also made it
mandatory that staff in long-term care disclose their COVID-19
vaccination status…Personal care services like haircuts have also
resumed and a limit on designated caregivers has been lifted.” Other
provinces and territories have gradually relaxed earlier restrictions in
long-term care homes, but not to the same extent as Ontario. New
Brunswick (NB) has tighter restrictions on less-than-fully vaccinated
LTC residents, non-Atlantic visitors and staff returning from trips
outside the Atlantic provinces. See Government of Canada, Province of NB

In the department of Landes, the prohibition on gatherings, meetings or

the same as in the general population, with additional safeguards
including: - It is no longer required to complete a self-questionnaire
on arrival. The traceability register is maintained; - Outings are
allowed, without limiting collective activities on return (except in the
case of risky contact), but maintaining screenings for unvaccinated
residents; - Day receptions are open normally. - Visits by relatives can
now be done without an appointment, in the room as in collective spaces.
They will be organized in such a way that distancing is respected from
other residents/families of residents. Vaccination is mandatory for all
people in contact with frail people (caregivers, non-caregivers,
professionals and volunteers).

Indoor events for 100 or more people are now only open to the
vaccinated, recovered, or those who present a negative COVID-19 PCR test
taken within 72 hours of the event. The Times of Israel reported: "“New
restrictions on public life came into effect midnight Tuesday, limiting
access to large indoor events and instating a raft of new fines for
those violating health rules, as Israel strives to contain a recent rise
in coronavirus infections.”“Under the new orders, the so-called Green
Pass system, first used earlier this year, will be reinstated for indoor
events attended by more than 100 people.”“Access to such gatherings is
now limited to those who are vaccinated or have recovered, or who
present a negative COVID-19 PCR test taken within 72 hours of the event.
A rapid virus test can also be used if taken within the previous 24
hours. While gatherings aren’t limited in size, face masks are
mandatory, except when eating or drinking.”“Venues are required to have
a dedicated coronavirus monitor who ensures that the rules are being
followed and are required to post signs that they are operating under
Green Pass rules, or face a NIS 3,000 fine ($911).”“Locations that have
both indoor and open-air areas are considered indoor sites under the
rules.”“Attendees who violate the rules will be fined NIS 1,000 ($303)
while venue operators can face a NIS 10,000 fine for not checking that
participants have the proper permits for entry.”“Police and inspectors
from local authorities will check up on venues hosting events that fall
under the rules to make sure they are complying.”" Sources:

In England, businesses are now all open, including nightclubs. While it
is recommended that nightclubs use a COVID-19 immunity pass, there is no
legal requirement to do so, so there are no measures or exemptions in
place as anyone can access any business. "“There are now no limits on
how many people can meet or attend events, nightclubs reopened at
midnight, and table service will not be necessary in pubs and
restaurants.”" Required closure sectors remain in other devolved
nations.

In England, "“face coverings will be recommended in some spaces, but not
required by law”" at national level. However, face masks still required
in London, coded as 0 as per interpretation guidance. However, reduced
capacity for trains in Scotland remains, to coding 1T for GBR "“In the
capital, passengers on all Transport for London (TfL) services -
including the Tube, bus, tram, Docklands Light Railway, Overground and
TfL Rail - will need to keep wearing a face covering in stations and for

London will be able to deny access or eject passengers who are found to
not be complying with the mask requirement.”"
