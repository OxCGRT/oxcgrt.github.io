This website contains recent policy changes reported in the global
[Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker
(OxCGRT)](www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/covidtracker) database. It includes policies
which have come into force within the last two weeks. It is arranged by
country and then by indicator. For more details on the coding policy
please see our
[Codebook](https://github.com/OxCGRT/covid-policy-tracker/blob/master/documentation/codebook.md)
and [Interpretation
Guide](https://github.com/OxCGRT/covid-policy-tracker/blob/master/documentation/interpretation_guide.md).

Data in the OxCGRT database is recorded by volunteers from all over the
world on a weekly schedule. Our coverage may not yet be completely
up-to-date until the present day with recent policy changes. This site
is updated daily, so check back for the latest information.

## Global Changes in Government Response Index

The Government Response Index is an aggregate summary of all 20 of our
policy indicators. The index goes from 0 to 100, and a higher number
generally means a more active policy (eg. more stringent restrictions,
more generous economic support, or more pro-active public health
measures).
<!-- The following map shows countries that have changed their response at some point during the last two weeks, resulting in an increase or decrease in the overall Government Response Index. -->
The headings for each country report how the index has changed from two
weeks ago. For more detail on the Government Response Index please see
our most recent [working
paper](https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/publications/variation-government-responses-covid-19)
or explore our [dataset
publication](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41562-021-01079-8).

From 14 Dec lockdown and lockouts have ended but some areas have
restrictions on workers who are unvaccinated. In NSW if you’re not fully
vaccinated, your employer must require you to work from home unless it’s
not reasonably practicable. Also many workers in the Northern Territory
are required to be vaccinated with a first dose of COVID-19 vaccine in
order to keep working. Workers need to be fully vaccinated by 24
December 2021.

the maximum number of people or households. • A mask must be worn in
closed rooms. This also applies to meetings outdoors. • Meetings can
only take place between 5:00 am and 11:00 pm. • For meetings of more
than 50 people, the organizers must appoint a COVID-19 officer and
develop and implement a COVID-19 prevention concept. • For meetings in
closed rooms and without assigned seats: o Access is only permitted with
valid 2-G proof. o Maximum limit: max. 25 people (including family
reunions, birthday parties, wedding parties, Christmas parties, etc. •
For meetings in closed rooms and with assigned seats: o Access is only

offer goods, food or drinks for sale, a 2G verification requirement and
an FFP2 mask requirement apply in closed rooms. • If there are more than
50 participants, the 2G rule and the recording of contact data do not
apply to gatherings of a maximum of four people from fewer than three
households plus six underage children of these people and minors for
whom these people perform existing supervisory duties. • For meetings
for rehearsals for professional purposes and for professional artistic
performance in a fixed composition, the following also applies: o In the
event of a positive test result, however, the patient can still be
admitted if there is no more symptoms for at least 48 hours after the
infection has ended and based on the medical laboratory results, in
particular on the basis of a CT value\> 30, it can be assumed that there
is no longer any risk of infection. o If a mask cannot be worn due to
the activity, other suitable protective measures must be taken to
minimize the risk of infection. • For meetings within the framework of
the Public Employment Service (initial and advanced training, retraining
and retraining as well as reintegration into the labor market, final
professional exams), the 3G certificate applies if physical contact
cannot be ruled out or the risk of infection can be minimized by other
suitable protective measures and wearing an FFP2 mask. If it is not
possible to wear a mask due to the nature of the training or the
integration measure of people, the risk of infection must be minimized
by other suitable protective measures. Sources:

On 6 December 2021, throughout Canada, businesses are open with varying
levels of restrictions. Many provinces now restrict access to some
non-essential businesses to fully vaccinated customers (or require proof
of a recent negative test). The Province of Alberta follows that
approach, but provides an opt-out with tighter restrictions for
businesses that do not wish to apply a vaccination/test mandate. In
Yukon Territory: “as of Dec. 4, proof of vaccination will no longer be
required … to access personal services”. See Retail Council of Canada,

should continue to stay at home when you’re sick. This will help reduce
the risk of spreading COVID-19 and other illnesses. Follow the
instructions of your local public health authority on COVID-19
quarantine or isolation requirements…Be prepared to stay at home if you
have symptoms of COVID-19 or need to care for someone who is sick.”

Iranian authorities have tightened entry restrictions for travellers
arriving from six African countries as of Dec, 01 due to concerns over
the Omicron variant of COVID-19. All foreign nationals arriving from
Botswana, Eswatini, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe are
banned from entering Iran until further notice. Iranian nationals
returning from these countries can enter but must undergo two negative
PCR tests or quarantine for up to 14 days. Fully vaccinated travellers
from other countries must present a negative PCR test result taken
within 96 hours before departure to gain entry. Unvaccinated citizens or
those who do not have a negative PCR test must quarantine for 14 days
upon arrival. Source: Garda World Archived link:
