This website contains recent policy changes reported in the global
[Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker
(OxCGRT)](www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/covidtracker) database. It includes policies
which have come into force within the last two weeks. It is arranged by
country and then by indicator. For more details on the coding policy
please see our
[Codebook](https://github.com/OxCGRT/covid-policy-tracker/blob/master/documentation/codebook.md)
and [Interpretation
Guide](https://github.com/OxCGRT/covid-policy-tracker/blob/master/documentation/interpretation_guide.md).

Data in the OxCGRT database is recorded by volunteers from all over the
world on a weekly schedule. Our coverage may not yet be completely
up-to-date until the present day with recent policy changes. This site
is updated daily, so check back for the latest information.

## Global Changes in Government Response Index

The Government Response Index is an aggregate summary of all 20 of our
policy indicators. The index goes from 0 to 100, and a higher number
generally means a more active policy (eg. more stringent restrictions,
more generous economic support, or more pro-active public health
measures).
<!-- The following map shows countries that have changed their response at some point during the last two weeks, resulting in an increase or decrease in the overall Government Response Index. -->
The headings for each country report how the index has changed from two
weeks ago. For more detail on the Government Response Index please see
our most recent [working
paper](https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/publications/variation-government-responses-covid-19)
or explore our [dataset
publication](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41562-021-01079-8).

exercise caution – e.g., St. John’s, NL: “When possible, consider social
distancing (ideally 2 metres apart)”; Winnipeg, Manitoba: “Consider
riding in off-peak hours if possible … Don’t board buses that don’t have
enough room for you to keep a distance between yourself and others.” See

Schools in many regions have resumed in-person learning, however, school
attendance is largely part-time through staggering grades or shortening
classes to reduce the number of students on-site at any one time. All
other days of the week for students are spent in online lessons. For
many wards and prefectures, online schooling is also a voluntary option
available to students and parents during the state of emergency. From
September 20 to 26, all public schools in Tokyo Metropolitan Area
announced there will be a temporary suspension of in-person learning
during Silver Week.
