This website contains recent policy changes reported in the global
[Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker
(OxCGRT)](www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/covidtracker) database. It includes policies
which have come into force within the last two weeks. It is arranged by
country and then by indicator. For more details on the coding policy
please see our
[Codebook](https://github.com/OxCGRT/covid-policy-tracker/blob/master/documentation/codebook.md)
and [Interpretation
Guide](https://github.com/OxCGRT/covid-policy-tracker/blob/master/documentation/interpretation_guide.md).

Data in the OxCGRT database is recorded by volunteers from all over the
world on a weekly schedule. Our coverage may not yet be completely
up-to-date until the present day with recent policy changes. This site
is updated daily, so check back for the latest information.

## Global Changes in Government Response Index

The Government Response Index is an aggregate summary of all 20 of our
policy indicators. The index goes from 0 to 100, and a higher number
generally means a more active policy (eg. more stringent restrictions,
more generous economic support, or more pro-active public health
measures).
<!-- The following map shows countries that have changed their response at some point during the last two weeks, resulting in an increase or decrease in the overall Government Response Index. -->
The headings for each country report how the index has changed from two
weeks ago. For more detail on the Government Response Index please see
our most recent [working
paper](https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/publications/variation-government-responses-covid-19)
or explore our [dataset
publication](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41562-021-01079-8).

On 9 september 2021, in Corner Brook, Newfoundland and Labrador (NL),
bus transit seating is no longer restricted below capacity. In Canada,
public transit measures do not extend beyond general recommendations to
exercise caution – e.g., St. John’s, NL: “When possible, consider social
distancing (ideally 2 metres apart)”; Winnipeg, Manitoba: “Consider
riding in off-peak hours if possible … Don’t board buses that don’t have
enough room for you to keep a distance between yourself and others.” See

2 September 2021 is the first effective date in the Northwest
Territories (NWT) that the town of Norman Wells “has instated a curfew
between the times of 12am and 6am” to all persons regardless of
vaccination status. The Government of Canada continues to advise: “As
efforts continue across Canada to increase overall vaccine coverage and
lower community transmission, public health measures remain the
foundation of the pandemic response… new variants of concern have been
identified and are circulating. This is why it’s even more important to
consistently use multiple personal preventive practices at once,
regardless of your vaccination status… Stay at home as much as possible,
especially if you’re at risk of more severe disease or outcomes from
COVID-19.” See Government of Canada and Town of Norman Wells websites,

Few states are at the "“2T”" level. See Kansas: On August 24,In response
to the continued spread of the Delta variant of the COVID-19 virus,
Governor Laura Kelly today released new guidance directing state
agencies under the jurisdiction of the Executive Branch to resume remote
work operations where possible. “Since the start of the pandemic, my
administration has followed the best public health guidance to keep our
communities safe, mitigate the spread of the virus, and reduce strain on
hospitals,” Governor Kelly said. “The decision to return to remote work
was not made lightly – but we know that this is a necessary step to
prevent COVID-19 infections. I am confident that our state employees
will continue to provide quality services to all Kansans who need them.”
The remote work model will remain in place through October 4th. At that
time, a re-assessment of current COVID-19 infection rates will determine
when state employees can return to fully on-site work. At the outset of
the COVID-19 pandemic, state agency operations shifted to remote work
for employees whose job functions could be performed remotely. In June,
after a significant reduction in daily COVID-19 infections, state
employees began returning to state office buildings. As infection
numbers began to rise again throughout the summer, a transition to
remote work will help control the spread of the virus among state
employees. Onsite staffing will be limited to only those necessary to
safely conduct agency operations. Mask requirements, social distancing
and other mitigation measures will remain in place for employees whose
jobs must be performed on-site. Public offices serving customers will be
encouraged to re-institute mitigation measures that were previously
utilized during the pandemic, such as scheduling “by appointment only”
or making allowances for virtual as opposed to in-person interactions.
All such measures will be carried out in a way as to have as minimal an
impact or inconvenience on customers. View the new guidance here.
