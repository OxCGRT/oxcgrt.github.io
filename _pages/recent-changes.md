This website contains recent policy changes reported in the global
[Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker
(OxCGRT)](www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/covidtracker) database. It includes policies
which have come into force within the last two weeks. It is arranged by
country and then by indicator. For more details on the coding policy
please see our
[Codebook](https://github.com/OxCGRT/covid-policy-tracker/blob/master/documentation/codebook.md)
and [Interpretation
Guide](https://github.com/OxCGRT/covid-policy-tracker/blob/master/documentation/interpretation_guide.md).

Data in the OxCGRT database is recorded by volunteers from all over the
world on a weekly schedule. Our coverage may not yet be completely
up-to-date until the present day with recent policy changes. This site
is updated daily, so check back for the latest information.

## Global Changes in Government Response Index

The Government Response Index is an aggregate summary of all 20 of our
policy indicators. The index goes from 0 to 100, and a higher number
generally means a more active policy (eg. more stringent restrictions,
more generous economic support, or more pro-active public health
measures).
<!-- The following map shows countries that have changed their response at some point during the last two weeks, resulting in an increase or decrease in the overall Government Response Index. -->
The headings for each country report how the index has changed from two
weeks ago. For more detail on the Government Response Index please see
our most recent [working
paper](https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/publications/variation-government-responses-covid-19)
or explore our [dataset
publication](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41562-021-01079-8).

NSW: no change in policy - stay at home orders are still in place and
are now being enforced by the military. "“Australia has deployed
hundreds of soldiers to Sydney to help enforce a Covid lockdown. A Delta
outbreak which began in June has produced nearly 3,000 infections and
led to nine deaths. Australian Defence Force soldiers will undergo
training on the weekend before beginning unarmed patrols on Monday. But
many have questioned whether the military intervention is necessary,
calling it heavy-handed. The lockdown - in place until at least 28
August - bars people from leaving their home except for essential
exercise, shopping, caregiving and other reasons.”" see here:

Effective 18 july 2021, the government of Canada continues to pay the
Canada Recovery Benefit (CRB) to self-employed Canadians who have lost
income, but the benefit for new claimants is now C$300/week. The
original C$500/week benefit level was about 50% of pre-crisis average
weekly earnings (excluding overtime) of just over C$1,000/week. The new
benefit level is just below 30% of pre-crisis average earnings. (Average
weekly earnings of employed Canadians have increased significantly in
part thanks to the reduction in employment in low-wage sectors such as
hospitality that have been hit harder by the covid crisis.) Employment
Insurance benefits and eligibility rules for formerly employed Canadians
continue to be enhanced relative to pre-covid rules. See Government of
Canada website, archived:

As of 29 july 2021, government of Canada guidance that when individuals
“test positive for COVID-19, a public health official will ask you
questions to collect important information about your symptoms;
activities and travel you did before you tested positive; all the people
you may have been in close contact with while you were contagious
…contact tracing. It’s a key public health measure.” Provinces and
territories have been applying this advice. However, in the province of
Alberta: “Starting July 29 All positive tests will continue to be
notified. Contact tracers will not notify close contacts of positive
cases, but will ask that individuals do so when informed of their
positive result. Contact tracers will continue to investigate cases in
high-risk settings, such as acute and continuing care.” See Government
of Canada and Province of Alberta websites, archived:

Since 21 July, a new protocol provides in long-term care facilities for
the elderly. Measures for the protection of residents implemented are
the same as in the general population, with additional safeguards
including: - It is no longer required to complete a self-questionnaire
on arrival. The traceability register is maintained; - Outings are
allowed, without limiting collective activities on return (except in the
case of risky contact), but maintaining screenings for unvaccinated
residents; - Day receptions are open normally. - Visits by relatives can
now be done without an appointment, in the room as in collective spaces.
They will be organized in such a way that distancing is respected from
other residents/families of residents. Vaccination is mandatory for all
people in contact with frail people (caregivers, non-caregivers,
professionals and volunteers).

Indoor events for 100 or more people are now only open to the
vaccinated, recovered, or those who present a negative COVID-19 PCR test
taken within 72 hours of the event. The Times of Israel reported: "“New
restrictions on public life came into effect midnight Tuesday, limiting
access to large indoor events and instating a raft of new fines for
those violating health rules, as Israel strives to contain a recent rise
in coronavirus infections.”“Under the new orders, the so-called Green
Pass system, first used earlier this year, will be reinstated for indoor
events attended by more than 100 people.”“Access to such gatherings is
now limited to those who are vaccinated or have recovered, or who
present a negative COVID-19 PCR test taken within 72 hours of the event.
A rapid virus test can also be used if taken within the previous 24
hours. While gatherings aren’t limited in size, face masks are
mandatory, except when eating or drinking.”“Venues are required to have
a dedicated coronavirus monitor who ensures that the rules are being
followed and are required to post signs that they are operating under
Green Pass rules, or face a NIS 3,000 fine ($911).”“Locations that have
both indoor and open-air areas are considered indoor sites under the
rules.”“Attendees who violate the rules will be fined NIS 1,000 ($303)
while venue operators can face a NIS 10,000 fine for not checking that
participants have the proper permits for entry.”“Police and inspectors
from local authorities will check up on venues hosting events that fall
under the rules to make sure they are complying.”" Sources:
