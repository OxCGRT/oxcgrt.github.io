This website contains recent policy changes reported in the global
[Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker
(OxCGRT)](www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/covidtracker) database. It includes policies
which have come into force within the last two weeks. It is arranged by
country and then by indicator. For more details on the coding policy
please see our
[Codebook](https://github.com/OxCGRT/covid-policy-tracker/blob/master/documentation/codebook.md)
and [Interpretation
Guide](https://github.com/OxCGRT/covid-policy-tracker/blob/master/documentation/interpretation_guide.md).

Data in the OxCGRT database is recorded by volunteers from all over the
world on a weekly schedule. Our coverage may not yet be completely
up-to-date until the present day with recent policy changes. This site
is updated daily, so check back for the latest information.

## Global Changes in Government Response Index

The Government Response Index is an aggregate summary of all 20 of our
policy indicators. The index goes from 0 to 100, and a higher number
generally means a more active policy (eg. more stringent restrictions,
more generous economic support, or more pro-active public health
measures).
<!-- The following map shows countries that have changed their response at some point during the last two weeks, resulting in an increase or decrease in the overall Government Response Index. -->
The headings for each country report how the index has changed from two
weeks ago. For more detail on the Government Response Index please see
our most recent [working
paper](https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/publications/variation-government-responses-covid-19)
or explore our [dataset
publication](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41562-021-01079-8).

On 07 August, Brunei detected its first local Covid-19 cases in over a
year, all of which were unlinked to previously-known imported cases.
Hence, Brunei has decided to tighten Covid measures, including
recommending people not to go out. Per the press release of 07 Aug by
the Ministry of Health, "“The public are advised to practice their
social responsibility by maintaining personal hygiene, having proper
sneeze etiquette, physical distancing and if feeling unwell, to abstain
from going to public places and attend social gatherings. Avoid going to
public places including shopping malls without purpose or essential
need; it is safer to stay at home.”" See the Ministry of Health’s press

allowed as follows: A group of 15 people for funeral management (not

Testing is widely available to support the green pass programme, but at
the individual’s expense for the non-vaccinated. "“Effective this
Sunday, 8.8.2021, anyone who has not been vaccinated will only be
admitted to complexes that comply with the Green Pass requirements upon
presenting negative test results to a rapid test taken 24 hours before
the time of admission.”“Rapid tests shall not be administered in HMO
clinics but rather in task-specific testing complexes, at the test
subject’s expense (once the Green Pass outline is applied to those aged
1-12 years, rapid tests for children from this age range shall be free
of charge).”“The Happy Pass scheme remains in effect and unchanged
(children may be admitted upon presenting negative results to a PCR test
taken in the HMO clinic or in a Home Front Command testing station,
until 20.8.2021).”" Source:

According to reports and interviews from prefectures of Tokyo and
Saitama, due to the high number of infections, close contact tracing has
been overwhelmed and efforts have shifted to targeted/priority settings
such as schools or elderly facilities. For other prefectures,
small-cluster contact tracing continues to be manually and
comprehensively conducted, in addition to the utilization of the
COVID-19 Contact-Confirming Application (COCOA).
