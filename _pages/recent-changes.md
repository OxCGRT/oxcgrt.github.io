This website contains recent policy changes reported in the global
[Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker
(OxCGRT)](www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/covidtracker) database. It includes policies
which have come into force within the last two weeks. It is arranged by
country and then by indicator. For more details on the coding policy
please see our
[Codebook](https://github.com/OxCGRT/covid-policy-tracker/blob/master/documentation/codebook.md)
and [Interpretation
Guide](https://github.com/OxCGRT/covid-policy-tracker/blob/master/documentation/interpretation_guide.md).

Data in the OxCGRT database is recorded by volunteers from all over the
world on a weekly schedule. Our coverage may not yet be completely
up-to-date until the present day with recent policy changes. This site
is updated daily, so check back for the latest information.

## Global Changes in Government Response Index

The Government Response Index is an aggregate summary of all 20 of our
policy indicators. The index goes from 0 to 100, and a higher number
generally means a more active policy (eg. more stringent restrictions,
more generous economic support, or more pro-active public health
measures).
<!-- The following map shows countries that have changed their response at some point during the last two weeks, resulting in an increase or decrease in the overall Government Response Index. -->
The headings for each country report how the index has changed from two
weeks ago. For more detail on the Government Response Index please see
our most recent [working
paper](https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/publications/variation-government-responses-covid-19)
or explore our [dataset
publication](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41562-021-01079-8).

3 January 2022 is the first day on the elementary and secondary public
school calendar after the holiday break in some Canadian jurisdictions.
However, school re-opening has been delayed in many jurisdictions. In
Quebec, the Premier announced that “schools, junior colleges and
universities won’t reopen to in-person classes until at least Jan. 17.”
This provincial government order applies to all Quebec post-secondary
institutions in contrast to other jurisdictions, where
vaccination/testing mandates or decisions to offer most classes online
are policies set by individual post-secondary institutions rather than
dictated by governments. See University Affairs Canada, Toronto Star

every Nunavut community: All non-essential businesses and government
offices are closed. Bars and licensed establishments are closed.
Restaurants may open for takeout only.” In the rest of Canada,
businesses are open with varying levels of restrictions. Many
jurisdictions restrict access to some non-essential businesses to fully
vaccinated customers (or require proof of a recent negative test). See

On 22 december 2021, Quebec Premier ‘Legault said he’s worried about
people who are age 60 or older because they are “the most vulnerable…
Ideally, they should stay home because that way there’s no risk”. In
Atlantic Canada, close and/or household contacts of those who test
positive have been instructed to stay home. See Montreal Gazette

Effective 31 december 2021: the province of “Quebec’s government is
imposing a nighttime curfew that will begin on New Year’s Eve in an
attempt to reduce the high transmission of COVID-19 across the province
and ease pressure on the hospital network. Premier Francois Legault told
reporters the curfew will run from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. for an indefinite
period of time.” In some other Canadian jurisdictions, close and/or
household contacts of those who test positive have been instructed to
stay home and/or all residents have been asked to work from home, if
possible. See Globe and Mail newspaper as well as governments of NL and

On 23 Dec. 2021, the Chief Public Health Officer of Canada continues to
advise that “a vaccines plus approach continues to be essential to the
pandemic response in Canada. This includes … getting tested if
symptomatic and/or as recommended”. The current policy intent of most
provinces and territories is to supplement polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) testing of symptomatic cases with mass availability of lateral
flow and other rapid tests. However the caseload wave is frustrating
efforts to achieve testing goals: ‘Faced with a tidal wave of COVID-19
cases, health officials in Alberta and in Montreal are asking residents
to rely on rapid home test kits rather than line up for the more
reliable PCR lab tests. Alberta axed general access to PCR tests on
Thursday, despite the widespread shortage of rapid test kits. The
province’s Chief Medical Officer of Health … asked those with
forthcoming PRC test appointments to cancel them … \[and\] said the
province dialled back PCR access to conserve the more accurate tests for
high-risk groups, such health care workers, continuing-care residents,
and those who qualify for antibody treatment because of their clinical
condition. “As Omicron is spreading …, no one in Canada will be able to
maintain PCR testing for every community case with mild symptoms” …
Alberta did not require residents using rapid tests to report a positive
result. The province will still track severe outcomes, such as death
\[and\] will also monitor the prevalence of COVID-19 with other tools,
such as wastewater data…Montreal public-health director … said
Montrealers who get a positive result from a rapid antigen test … need
not undertake another screening to confirm their status…the local health
authority … around Vancouver has begun rationing PCR tests … only people
deemed by medical experts to be “at greater risk of severe disease from
COVID-19? are being given these tests on site.” See government of Canada

There are a two exceptions: face masks are not considered necessary
outdoors “during individual sports” (for example, going for a jog or a
cycle on your own) or “during activities that are not sporting in
nature, but are carried out in natural spaces”, such as hanging out at
the beach or hiking in the forest. These exceptions are contingent on
the 1.5 metre social distancing rules being maintained. The face mask
can also be removed outdoors in Spain by those travelling by boat, an
exception that was included in the previous law. However, the new rules
make masks mandatory below deck, even if social distancing is
maintained. Face masks will not be mandatory inside residences, centres
for people with disabilities, or similar homes, provided that the
vaccination rate is 80 percent or higher with the full schedule and
booster doses. External visitors and workers at these centers are still
required to wear face masks.
