This website contains recent policy changes reported in the global
[Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker
(OxCGRT)](www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/covidtracker) database. It includes policies
which have come into force within the last two weeks. It is arranged by
country and then by indicator. For more details on the coding policy
please see our
[Codebook](https://github.com/OxCGRT/covid-policy-tracker/blob/master/documentation/codebook.md)
and [Interpretation
Guide](https://github.com/OxCGRT/covid-policy-tracker/blob/master/documentation/interpretation_guide.md).

Data in the OxCGRT database is recorded by volunteers from all over the
world on a weekly schedule. Our coverage may not yet be completely
up-to-date until the present day with recent policy changes. This site
is updated daily, so check back for the latest information.

## Global Changes in Government Response Index

The Government Response Index is an aggregate summary of all 20 of our
policy indicators. The index goes from 0 to 100, and a higher number
generally means a more active policy (eg. more stringent restrictions,
more generous economic support, or more pro-active public health
measures).
<!-- The following map shows countries that have changed their response at some point during the last two weeks, resulting in an increase or decrease in the overall Government Response Index. -->
The headings for each country report how the index has changed from two
weeks ago. For more detail on the Government Response Index please see
our most recent [working
paper](https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/publications/variation-government-responses-covid-19)
or explore our [dataset
publication](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41562-021-01079-8).

On 25 august 2021, the government of Northwest Territories (NWT) orders
in the town of Norman Wells: “Non-essential businesses and facilities
must close to the public … Essential businesses and facilities may
remain open to the public with no more than ten (10) persons … Physical
distancing of at least 2 metres shall be maintained amongst persons from
different households”. In Manitoba, businesses are open with guidelines,
but access to casinos and bingo halls is restricted to fully vaccinated
patrons with “proof-of-immunization cards”. Some provinces – e.g.,
Alberta, Saskatchewan, New Brunswick – have revoked covid-related public
health requirements for business operations. See government of NWT

On 26 august 2021, in the Northwest Territories (NWT), the town of
Norman Wells makes clear that the gathering prohibition applies across
the board: “There are no gatherings allowed at this time either indoor
or outdoor.” In some provinces and territories, public events are
permitted with capacity limits, mask requirements and other guidelines.
Some provinces – e.g., Alberta, Saskatchewan, New Brunswick – have
revoked covid-related public health requirements for public events. In
the province of Manitoba, professional sporting events, horse and auto
racing, concert halls and outdoor performing arts events continue to be
limited to vaccinated individuals. See government of NWT website, Retail
