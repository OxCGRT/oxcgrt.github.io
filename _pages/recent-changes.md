This website contains recent policy changes reported in the global
[Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker
(OxCGRT)](www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/covidtracker) database. It includes policies
which have come into force within the last two weeks. It is arranged by
country and then by indicator. For more details on the coding policy
please see our
[Codebook](https://github.com/OxCGRT/covid-policy-tracker/blob/master/documentation/codebook.md)
and [Interpretation
Guide](https://github.com/OxCGRT/covid-policy-tracker/blob/master/documentation/interpretation_guide.md).

Data in the OxCGRT database is recorded by volunteers from all over the
world on a weekly schedule. Our coverage may not yet be completely
up-to-date until the present day with recent policy changes. This site
is updated daily, so check back for the latest information.

## Global Changes in Government Response Index

The Government Response Index is an aggregate summary of all 20 of our
policy indicators. The index goes from 0 to 100, and a higher number
generally means a more active policy (eg. more stringent restrictions,
more generous economic support, or more pro-active public health
measures).
<!-- The following map shows countries that have changed their response at some point during the last two weeks, resulting in an increase or decrease in the overall Government Response Index. -->
The headings for each country report how the index has changed from two
weeks ago. For more detail on the Government Response Index please see
our most recent [working
paper](https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/publications/variation-government-responses-covid-19)
or explore our [dataset
publication](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41562-021-01079-8).

typically be released once the test result is negative. Vaccinated
persons will take a COVID-19 PCR test upon arrival and must remain in
quarantine until a negative test result is received. Due to limited
capacity, the government quarantine facilities which are provided free
of cost and used for accommodation prior to 2nd tests will be reserved
for Barbadians and permanent residents arriving in Barbados.

Botswana is now prioritizing those 45 years and older, although those
over 30 are also eligible for the vaccine. Johnson and Johnson and

demand.

On 25 august 2021, the government of Northwest Territories (NWT) orders
in the town of Norman Wells: “Non-essential businesses and facilities
must close to the public … Essential businesses and facilities may
remain open to the public with no more than ten (10) persons … Physical
distancing of at least 2 metres shall be maintained amongst persons from
different households”. In Manitoba, businesses are open with guidelines,
but access to casinos and bingo halls is restricted to fully vaccinated
patrons with “proof-of-immunization cards”. Some provinces – e.g.,
Alberta, Saskatchewan, New Brunswick – have revoked covid-related public
health requirements for business operations. See government of NWT

On 26 august 2021, in the Northwest Territories (NWT), the town of
Norman Wells makes clear that the gathering prohibition applies across
the board: “There are no gatherings allowed at this time either indoor
or outdoor.” In some provinces and territories, public events are
permitted with capacity limits, mask requirements and other guidelines.
Some provinces – e.g., Alberta, Saskatchewan, New Brunswick – have
revoked covid-related public health requirements for public events. In
the province of Manitoba, professional sporting events, horse and auto
racing, concert halls and outdoor performing arts events continue to be
limited to vaccinated individuals. See government of NWT website, Retail

As of the 20th of August 2021, Singapore began opening up the borders,
even to previously banned countries, and will be restructuring the
framework for handling inbound travellers.
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Quote (1): "“10. As a first step, we
have reviewed the country/ region classifications for our border
measures. Countries/ regions will be classified in one of four
categories, each with differentiated border measures, premised on a
traveller’s 21-day travel history prior to their entry into Singapore.
If the traveller visits or transits through countries/ regions in
different categories, the most stringent set of requirements among those
countries/ regions will apply. The updated classification, together with
the associated testing requirements, can be found in Annex B and on the
SafeTravel website. a. Category I – Travellers from countries/ regions
in this category can enter Singapore without having to serve a Stay-Home
Notice (SHN). They will only be subject to an On-Arrival COVID-19 PCR2
and if negative, will be allowed to go about their activities. This
would include countries/regions such as Mainland China (excluding
Jiangsu province), New Zealand and Taiwan today. i. We have reviewed the
COVID-19 situation in Hong Kong and Macao, and will also add them to
this category from 20 August 2021, 2359 hours. See Annex C for details.
b. Category II – Travellers from countries/ regions in this category
will be required to undergo a 7-day SHN, which can be served at their
accommodation of choice. Singapore Citizens, Permanent Residents and
Long-Term Pass Holders may serve their 7-day SHN at their place of
residence, if conditions are suitable. Currently, only Mainland China
(Jiangsu province) is in this category. i. We have reviewed the COVID-19
situation in Australia, Canada, and Germany, and will add these
countries/ regions to this category from 20 August 2021, 2359 hours. We
have also reviewed the COVID-19 situation in Brunei, and will place them
in this category from 20 August 2021, 2359 hours (see Annex C).
c. Category III – Unvaccinated travellers from countries/ regions in
this category will be required to undergo a 14-day SHN at dedicated SHN
facilities. Travellers who are fully vaccinated3 may apply to opt out of
dedicated SHN facilities and serve their 14-day SHN at a suitable
accommodation of their choice, if they fulfil the criteria in Annex D.
Currently, Austria, Italy, Norway, the Republic of Korea and Switzerland
are in this category. i. We have reviewed the COVID-19 situation in
Belgium, Denmark, Japan and Luxembourg, and will add these countries/
regions to this category from 20 August 2021, 2359 hrs. d. Category IV –
Travellers from all other countries/ regions (except Bangladesh, India,
Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, where entry is currently not
allowed4) will be required to undergo a 14-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN) at
dedicated SHN facilities. Travellers will also be required to comply
with the testing regime as indicated in Annex B. Starting Vaccinated
Travel Lanes 11. Beyond the above framework, we will implement a new
Vaccinated Travel Lane (VTL) to facilitate fully vaccinated persons to
travel into Singapore under reduced border measures. We will start pilot
VTL arrangements with Brunei and Germany. In lieu of SHN, these
vaccinated travellers under the VTL will undergo multiple COVID-19 PCR
tests, including a pre-departure PCR test within 48 hours of their
scheduled departure for Singapore, an on-arrival PCR test upon arriving
in Singapore, and two additional PCR tests on Days 3 and 7 of their stay
in Singapore (if they have not left yet). 12. The number of VTL
travellers will be limited by available flights dedicated to the scheme.
VTL travellers must also travel on non-stop designated flights to
Singapore. 13. Prior to travelling to Singapore, short-term visitors and
Long-Term Pass holders who wish to travel under the VTL will need to
apply for a Vaccinated Travel Pass between 7 and 30 days before their
intended date of entry into Singapore. Applications for the VTP will
start from 1 September 2021 for travel into Singapore from 8 September
2021. Returning Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents who are
vaccinated will automatically qualify and will not need to apply for the
VTP in order to travel under the VTL. The Civil Aviation Authority of
Singapore will provide more details. 14. As the global situation
evolves, we will continue to adjust our border measures in tandem with
our roadmap to becoming a COVID resilient nation. Any changes to border
measures will be updated on the SafeTravel website. Travellers are
advised to visit the website to check the latest border measures for the
associated country or region before entering Singapore.”" Link (1):

Self-pay COVID-19 test is widely available at hospitals throughout
Taiwan. On August 23, the Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) pointed
out that it has formulated strengthened COVID-19 surveillance programs
listed below to reduce the risk of the Delta variant entering
communities in Taiwan. A. To enhance community surveillance, the CECC
will distribute government-funded COVID-19 home test kits to contracted
clinics in cities and counties on August 30. Based on their diagnosis,
doctors can provide the home test kits to high-risk individuals who will
use the test kits to test themselves and report back their test result.
B. To monitor the health of certain high-risk personnel at international
airports, certain high-risk personnel at Taoyuan International Airport,
Taipei Songshan Airport, Taichung International Airport, and Kaohsiung
International Airport will be tested for COVID-19 using
government-funded home test kits every seven days starting August 30. C.
Expanding wastewater surveillance. D. Conducting surveys on the
seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among blood donors. E.
Continuing surveillance on imported frozen foods and their packaging.

last year and revised this guideline to set a clear timeline of the
policy until December 2021, and allow banks to gradually provision for
loan forbearance until December 2023 while normalizing the loan
classification in Jan 2024. As of end-May 2021, banks have registered a
credit package totaling VND 300 trillion (about 3.8 percent of GDP) at
lower interest rates, and supported nearly 1.42 million customers (with
outstanding loans of about VND 3,300 trillion), by rescheduling
repayment, exempting, and reducing interest on existing debts, and
extending new loans. Recently the SBV also asked Credit Institutions to
not only channel credit to 5 priority economic sectors, but also to
accelerate consumer loans to meet legitimate demand of individuals and
households. The SBV has delayed the phased reduction of the ratio of
short-term funding to finance long term loans for one year, to help
credit institutions reduce their cost of funding and maintain
medium-long term loans outstanding. Financial institutions have been
exempting and reducing payment fees until June 30, 2021. Several
securities service fees have been cut and exemptions have been extended
through December 30, 2021”"
