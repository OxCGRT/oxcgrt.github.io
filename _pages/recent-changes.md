This website contains recent policy changes reported in the global
[Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker
(OxCGRT)](www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/covidtracker) database. It includes policies
which have come into force within the last two weeks. It is arranged by
country and then by indicator. For more details on the coding policy
please see our
[Codebook](https://github.com/OxCGRT/covid-policy-tracker/blob/master/documentation/codebook.md)
and [Interpretation
Guide](https://github.com/OxCGRT/covid-policy-tracker/blob/master/documentation/interpretation_guide.md).

Data in the OxCGRT database is recorded by volunteers from all over the
world on a weekly schedule. Our coverage may not yet be completely
up-to-date until the present day with recent policy changes. This site
is updated daily, so check back for the latest information.

## Global Changes in Government Response Index

The Government Response Index is an aggregate summary of all 20 of our
policy indicators. The index goes from 0 to 100, and a higher number
generally means a more active policy (eg. more stringent restrictions,
more generous economic support, or more pro-active public health
measures).
<!-- The following map shows countries that have changed their response at some point during the last two weeks, resulting in an increase or decrease in the overall Government Response Index. -->
The headings for each country report how the index has changed from two
weeks ago. For more detail on the Government Response Index please see
our most recent [working
paper](https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/publications/variation-government-responses-covid-19)
or explore our [dataset
publication](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41562-021-01079-8).

Effective 3 August 2021, the province of Ontario is “permitting school
boards to offer in-person summer school in August with strict health and
safety measures in place” and continuing “efforts ahead of September to
deliver a safe, and more normal in-person learning experience”. Ontario
closed schools for in-class learning with teaching online over the last
3 months of the regular school year ending in June and required that
“School boards are delivering virtual summer programming in July.”
Elementary and secondary schools throughout Canada are on the regular
summer break. In most of the rest of Canada, schools finished the year
open for in-class learning. Those provinces and territories that have
announced plans for the school year starting in September 2021 intend to
start with in-class learning. Many post-secondary institutions in Canada
offered online classes during the past academic year and are continuing
to do so for summer courses. For the most part, teachers or students
starting classes at all levels in September will NOT be required to
provide proof of vaccination, immunity or negative test to attend
classes(with the exception of at least one faculty of medicine and one
Ontario college). Vaccination proof will be required to live in student
housing operated by some post-secondary education institutions. See

government buildings are reducing in-office work for public servants (to
50 percent), with the private sector encouraged to allow employees to
work from home "“Due to the significant increase in the infection rate

implemented and we cannot guarantee that proof of vaccination will waive
the required PCR test upon arrival.
