This website contains recent policy changes reported in the global
[Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker
(OxCGRT)](www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/covidtracker) database. It includes policies
which have come into force within the last two weeks. It is arranged by
country and then by indicator. For more details on the coding policy
please see our
[Codebook](https://github.com/OxCGRT/covid-policy-tracker/blob/master/documentation/codebook.md)
and [Interpretation
Guide](https://github.com/OxCGRT/covid-policy-tracker/blob/master/documentation/interpretation_guide.md).

Data in the OxCGRT database is recorded by volunteers from all over the
world on a weekly schedule. Our coverage may not yet be completely
up-to-date until the present day with recent policy changes. This site
is updated daily, so check back for the latest information.

## Global Changes in Government Response Index

The Government Response Index is an aggregate summary of all 20 of our
policy indicators. The index goes from 0 to 100, and a higher number
generally means a more active policy (eg. more stringent restrictions,
more generous economic support, or more pro-active public health
measures).
<!-- The following map shows countries that have changed their response at some point during the last two weeks, resulting in an increase or decrease in the overall Government Response Index. -->
The headings for each country report how the index has changed from two
weeks ago. For more detail on the Government Response Index please see
our most recent [working
paper](https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/publications/variation-government-responses-covid-19)
or explore our [dataset
publication](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41562-021-01079-8).

o changes. On 07 August, Brunei detected its first local Covid-19 cases
in over a year, all of which were unlinked to previously-known imported
cases. Hence, Brunei has decided to tighten Covid measures, including
instituting mandatory mask measures. Per the press release of 07 Aug by
the Ministry of Health, "“Meanwhile, to address the concerns on the
spread of Delta variant around the world, including in Brunei
Darussalam, the Ministry of Health would also like to inform the public
on the changes in the face mask guidelines: 1. Face masks are required
be worn at all times, especially indoors or in crowded places either
indoor or outdoor. 2. Face mask must cover the wearer’s nose and mouth.
3. This directive is applicable to all individuals regardless of their
vaccination status.”" Per the US Embassy in Brunei’s website, last
updated on 14 Dec, "“Face masks are mandatory at all times in all indoor
and outdoor spaces.”" This advice is confirmed in a press conference
conducted by the Minister at the Prime Minister’s Office, YB Dato Dr Hj
Mohd Amin, on 12th December, "“During this period, wearing of face masks
and use of the Bruhealth contact tracing app will still be mandatory,
and the 10pm to 4am curfew will still be in place.”" See the Ministry of

The UK is removing all countries from its red travel list, just weeks
after reactivating the list in response to the new Omicron variant. As
of tomorrow, 15 December, people arriving from 11 African countries will
no longer need to stay in one of the government-run quarantine hotels.
People currently in a UK quarantine hotel will also be allowed to leave
early, as long as they do not test positive for COVID-19. However all
current testing requirements will remain in place, Transport Secretary
Grant Shapps confirmed on Twitter this afternoon. he UK recently updated
its travel rules, stipulating that all arrivals must now show a negative
pre-departure PCR or lateral flow test that was taken within 48 hours of
arriving. This is in addition to a day 2 PCR test, which both UK
citizens and visitors must await the results of in isolation. The rules
vary for unvaccinated travellers.
