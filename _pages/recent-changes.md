This website contains recent policy changes reported in the global
[Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker
(OxCGRT)](www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/covidtracker) database. It includes policies
which have come into force within the last two weeks. It is arranged by
country and then by indicator. For more details on the coding policy
please see our
[Codebook](https://github.com/OxCGRT/covid-policy-tracker/blob/master/documentation/codebook.md)
and [Interpretation
Guide](https://github.com/OxCGRT/covid-policy-tracker/blob/master/documentation/interpretation_guide.md).

Data in the OxCGRT database is recorded by volunteers from all over the
world on a weekly schedule. Our coverage may not yet be completely
up-to-date until the present day with recent policy changes. This site
is updated daily, so check back for the latest information.

## Global Changes in Government Response Index

The Government Response Index is an aggregate summary of all 20 of our
policy indicators. The index goes from 0 to 100, and a higher number
generally means a more active policy (eg. more stringent restrictions,
more generous economic support, or more pro-active public health
measures).
<!-- The following map shows countries that have changed their response at some point during the last two weeks, resulting in an increase or decrease in the overall Government Response Index. -->
The headings for each country report how the index has changed from two
weeks ago. For more detail on the Government Response Index please see
our most recent [working
paper](https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/publications/variation-government-responses-covid-19)
or explore our [dataset
publication](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41562-021-01079-8).

based on the medical laboratory results, in particular on the basis of a
CT value\> 30, it can be assumed that there is no longer any risk of
infection. o If a mask cannot be worn due to the activity, other
suitable protective measures must be taken to minimize the risk of
infection. • For meetings within the framework of the labor market
service (training and further education, etc.), FFP2 mask requirements
as well as 3G proof apply if physical contact cannot be ruled out or the
risk of infection can be minimized by other suitable protective
measures. If it is not possible to wear a mask due to the nature of the
training or the integration measures of people, the risk of infection
must be minimized by means of suitable protective measures. Source:

3 January 2022 is the first day on the elementary and secondary public
school calendar after the holiday break in some Canadian jurisdictions.
However, school re-opening has been delayed in many jurisdictions. In
Quebec, the Premier announced that “schools, junior colleges and
universities won’t reopen to in-person classes until at least Jan. 17.”
This provincial government order applies to all Quebec post-secondary
institutions in contrast to other jurisdictions, where
vaccination/testing mandates or decisions to offer most classes online
are policies set by individual post-secondary institutions rather than
dictated by governments. See University Affairs Canada, Toronto Star

reporters the curfew will run from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. for an indefinite
period of time.” In some other Canadian jurisdictions, close and/or
