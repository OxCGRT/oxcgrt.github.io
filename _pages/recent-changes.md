This website contains recent policy changes reported in the global
[Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker
(OxCGRT)](www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/covidtracker) database. It includes policies
which have come into force within the last two weeks. It is arranged by
country and then by indicator. For more details on the coding policy
please see our
[Codebook](https://github.com/OxCGRT/covid-policy-tracker/blob/master/documentation/codebook.md)
and [Interpretation
Guide](https://github.com/OxCGRT/covid-policy-tracker/blob/master/documentation/interpretation_guide.md).

Data in the OxCGRT database is recorded by volunteers from all over the
world on a weekly schedule. Our coverage may not yet be completely
up-to-date until the present day with recent policy changes. This site
is updated daily, so check back for the latest information.

## Global Changes in Government Response Index

The Government Response Index is an aggregate summary of all 20 of our
policy indicators. The index goes from 0 to 100, and a higher number
generally means a more active policy (eg. more stringent restrictions,
more generous economic support, or more pro-active public health
measures).
<!-- The following map shows countries that have changed their response at some point during the last two weeks, resulting in an increase or decrease in the overall Government Response Index. -->
The headings for each country report how the index has changed from two
weeks ago. For more detail on the Government Response Index please see
our most recent [working
paper](https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/publications/variation-government-responses-covid-19)
or explore our [dataset
publication](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41562-021-01079-8).

virus’ aggressiveness is still unclear, measures taken by other
countries of the world, the Committee of Experts in Albania, decided to
recommend the ban on the entry of foreign nationals with travel history
within the last 14 days, starting from December 3, 2021 for three weeks,
for countries: - South Africa - Kenya - Angola - Zambia - Botswana -
Senegal Resident Albanian citizens, who come to Albania and have a

Are PCR and/or antigen tests available for U.S. citizens in Albania? Yes
If so, are test results reliably available within one calendar day? Yes
Airport Covid-19 PCR test: Tirana International Airport offers a
Covid-19 PCR test for travelers. For more information, visit their
website. Public Health Labs: Currently, to be tested for COVID-19 by the
Albanian public health authority one must have symptoms and a
recommendation from the public health authority’s family doctor.
However, private testing labs will perform a test for a fee, and no
symptoms or a doctor’s recommendation is required (see details below).
If you have an Albanian social security number, you also have an
assigned public health family doctor. To learn who your public health
family doctor is, call the help line at 0-800-4040 to find out. Tests
are free of charge if done by the Albanian Institute of Public Health
(IPH). Private Labs: Individuals can also arrange private testing by
going to a private testing lab. No symptoms or doctor’s order is
required to arrange a private test, and no advance appointment is
necessary. According to the Albanian Ministry of Health and Social
Protection, there are several private labs authorized to perform
SARS-CoV-2 testing for administrative issues. For a full list, please
see the Ministry of Health list here.

From 13 Jan to 20 Jan there are lockouts in the NT areas of Amoonguna,
Yuendumu and Yuelamu. During a lockout, fully vaccinated residents can
live normally within a lockout area. Unvaccinated people aged 16 years

COVID-19 vaccine, must stay at home during a lockout period and are only
permitted to leave for essential reasons. You can’t travel more than
30km from your home when leaving for 1 of the 3 reasons. If you need to
go to the hospital and it’s more than 30km from your home, that’s
permitted.

On 17 January 2022, “non-essential businesses may open” in Nunavut
Territory. Throughout Canada, businesses are open with different levels
of restrictions in different provinces and territories. Many
jurisdictions restrict access to some non-essential businesses to fully
vaccinated customers (or require proof of a recent negative test). The
Province of Alberta follows that approach, but allows an opt-out for
businesses that do not wish to apply a vaccination/test mandate if they
accept lower capacity limits. See Nunavut News and Globe and Mail
newspaper and governments of Nunavut and Alberta websites, archived:

The Thai government has ordered entertainment venues catering to the
nightlife to remain closed for the foreseeable future. While the
government intends to relax restrictions in other economic sectors, it
views these venues as being particularly high-risk for COVID-19
transmission. Correlates with Tourism Authority of Thailand update on
23rd January 2022, stating that “all types of entertainment venues,
including pubs, bars, and karaoke shops nationwide are to remain closed
until further notice.” It is noted that in practice, some of such venues
have been able to re-open as “restaurants” or “eateries” if they alter
their services and meet certain government requirements. Other sources
